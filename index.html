  Before the Iron Yard, I hadn't been doing much, other than participating in an internship at good will to teach front end
  coding. I suppose it would be more interesting if I told you how got interested in coding. Back in tenth grade, I thought I
  wanted to be an architect. I learned later into my first class to become an architect that I would rather spend time on the computer
  aspect of the program, but unfortunatly, that was only a small part of the course. I ended up quitting the class because I lost motivation.
  So instead, after about a year, I really decided that I would like to get into coding, although, i wasn't quite sure how.
  I went ahead and put coding into the back of my mind, at least until I would finish highschool. I would later finish highschool
  at the Excel Center. I actually almost ended up forgetting all about coding and just going into business. I took some college
  classes, including taking part of a business class. About half way through the course, I got a call from the career advisor from
  the Excel Center, allerting me to an internship with Goodwill for front end coding. I decided to go, and along with the internship
  would come a paid for program that would would be the Iron Yard. I probably could have gone more into detail, but I hope that
  this gives you a better idea of how I got here.
